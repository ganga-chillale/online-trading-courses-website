            <h2>What is Trading?</h2>
            <p>Trading is the process of buying and selling financial assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, or derivatives with the aim of making a profit. It involves the exchange of these assets between buyers and sellers in various markets, often through organized exchanges like stock markets or over-the-counter (OTC) markets.<br>

                Key Aspects of Trading:<br>
                Assets Traded:<br>
                
                Stocks: Shares of ownership in a company.<br>
                Bonds: Debt securities issued by entities like governments or corporations.<br>
                Commodities: Physical goods such as gold, oil, or agricultural products.<br>
                Currencies: Exchange of different national currencies (Forex trading).<br>
                Derivatives: Financial contracts whose value is derived from underlying assets, like options and futures.<br>
                Types of Trading:<br>
                
                Day Trading: Buying and selling assets within the same trading day.
                Swing Trading: Holding assets for several days or weeks to take advantage of expected price changes.
                Position Trading: Holding assets for a longer period, usually months or years, based on long-term trends.<br>
                Markets:<br>
                
                Stock Market: Where shares of publicly traded companies are bought and sold.<br>
                Forex Market: Where currencies are exchanged.<br>
                Commodity Market: Where commodities like oil and gold are traded.<br>
                Cryptocurrency Market: Where digital currencies like Bitcoin are traded.<br>
                Strategies:
                
                Technical Analysis: Using charts and indicators to predict future price movements.
                Fundamental Analysis: Analyzing economic factors and company performance to determine asset value.
                Risks: Trading carries risks, including market risk (price changes), liquidity risk (difficulty in buying/selling), and leverage risk (using borrowed funds).<br>
                
                Purpose of Trading:
                Profit: The primary goal is to buy low and sell high, making a profit from the difference.
                Hedging: Some traders use trading to protect against potential losses in other investments.
                Speculation: Betting on price movements to make profits, often involving higher risk.
                In summary, trading is a dynamic activity that requires knowledge of markets, strategies, and risk management. Whether done as a full-time profession or part-time hobby, it can be a way to grow wealth, though it also involves significant risks<br></p>
