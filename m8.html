Entry Criteria: Define the conditions under which you will enter a trade, such as technical indicators, chart patterns, or fundamental factors.
Exit Criteria: Establish rules for exiting trades, including profit-taking strategies and stop-loss levels.
Risk Management: Determine how much capital you’re willing to risk on each trade and overall. Set guidelines for position sizing, stop-loss orders, and take-profit levels.
<br>5. Create a Risk Management Plan
Capital Allocation: Decide how much of your total capital will be allocated to each trade and overall trading activity.
Leverage: Determine the level of leverage you will use, if any, and ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance.
Diversification: Plan how to diversify your trades to minimize risk exposure to any single asset or sector.
<br>6. Set Up a Trading Routine
