            <h2>Fundamental Analysis</h2>
            <p><br>
                Technical analysis is a method used by traders to evaluate and predict the future price movements of financial assets based on historical price data, volume, and other market statistics. Here are the basics of technical analysis:<br>

                1. Price Charts
                Line Chart: Plots the closing prices of an asset over time, forming a continuous line.
                Bar Chart: Displays the open, high, low, and close (OHLC) prices for a specific period.
                Candlestick Chart: Similar to bar charts but visually more informative. Candlesticks show the OHLC prices with a "body" indicating the range between open and close, and "wicks" showing the high and low.<br>
                2. Support and Resistance
                Support Level: A price level where an asset tends to stop falling and may reverse upwards due to buying interest.
                Resistance Level: A price level where an asset tends to stop rising and may reverse downwards due to selling pressure.
                <br>3. Trend Analysis
                Uptrend: A series of higher highs and higher lows, indicating an overall increase in price.
                Downtrend: A series of lower highs and lower lows, indicating an overall decrease in price.
                Sideways/Range-bound Trend: When prices move within a horizontal range without a clear upward or downward direction.
                <br>4. Moving Averages
                Simple Moving Average (SMA): The average price of an asset over a specific number of periods (e.g., 20-day SMA).
                Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.
                <br>5. Indicators and Oscillators
                Relative Strength Index (RSI): Measures the speed and change of price movements, indicating overbought or oversold conditions (typically, RSI above 70 is overbought, below 30 is oversold).
                Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): Shows the relationship between two moving averages of a price and can signal buy/sell opportunities.
                Bollinger Bands: Consists of a moving average and two standard deviation lines above and below it, indicating volatility and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
                <br>6. Volume Analysis
                Volume: The number of shares or contracts traded in a given period. High volume often confirms the strength of a price movement.
                On-Balance Volume (OBV): A cumulative volume indicator that adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days, helping to confirm trends.
                <br>7. Chart Patterns
                Head and Shoulders: A reversal pattern that signals a change in trend direction.
                Double Top/Bottom: A reversal pattern indicating a potential trend change after two peaks (top) or two troughs (bottom).
                Triangles: Continuation patterns that form as the price narrows between converging trendlines (ascending, descending, or symmetrical).
                <br>8. Fibonacci Retracement
                Fibonacci Levels: Horizontal lines that indicate potential support and resistance levels based on key Fibonacci ratios (e.g., 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%).
                <br> 9. Candlestick Patterns
                Doji: A pattern where the open and close prices are virtually the same, indicating indecision in the market.
                Hammer: A bullish reversal pattern that forms after a downtrend, with a small body and a long lower wick.
                Engulfing: A reversal pattern where one candlestick fully engulfs the previous one, signaling a potential trend reversal.
                <br>10. Divergence
                Bullish Divergence: Occurs when the price makes lower lows, but an indicator (like RSI or MACD) makes higher lows, suggesting a potential upward reversal.
                Bearish Divergence: Occurs when the price makes higher highs, but an indicator makes lower highs, suggesting a potential downward reversal.<br>
                <br><br>Key Principles of Technical Analysis:<br>
                Market Price Reflects All Information: Prices already incorporate all available information, including news, earnings, and market sentiment.<br>
                History Tends to Repeat Itself: Market patterns and trends are likely to repeat over time.<br>
                Price Moves in Trends: Assets tend to move in identifiable trends, which can be used to make trading decisions.<br><br><br>
                By mastering these basics, traders can use technical analysis to identify potential trading opportunities and manage risk effectively.
